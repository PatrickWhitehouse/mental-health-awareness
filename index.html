    <p>Hey, I'm Patrick. Mental health has been been a huge part of my life so far. Mental health is something that we should not be ashamed of, it is something that we should embrace and talk about, as at the end of the day, we're only human.</p>
    <p>I will be using this site as a 'diary' where I can express my feelings and more importantly, let others know that <strong>you're not alone.</strong></p>

    <h3 class="title is-3">When did it all start?</h3>
    <p>Back in September 2010, I lost one of the most important people in my life, my grandad. We were alike in so many ways, but the most obvious being our looks and personalities. I'm even told to this day by family members how alike we are. He adored me, just as much as I adored him. </p>

    <p>During my time at primary school, I was one of the most outgoing, active and confident young kids there could have ever been. I played football, basketball, went to swimming lessons, participated in karate and even learnt to play the guitar. I was even fortunate enough to have the opportunity to play football at a semi-professional level. Everyone was so proud of me, espcially my grandad.</p>
    <p>I started high school not knowing anyone as I went to an all boys school. I found it hard mixing in there and making friends. Luckily, I made a few and went through high school with no issues at all. I wasn't popular at school so I spent most of my holidays playing on a games console, or playing football on a field. I reached year 10 and started studying for my GCSE's. A couple of weeks into the first term of the year, my grandad was taken into hospital with pneumonia. A few years before this, my grandad was diagnosed with Parkinsons and he had deteriorated quite a bit in the space of a few years which was heartbreaking to see. It was hard seeing the affect it was having on my mother and nan. As his muscles were so weak, he was struggling to do simple day to day tasks such holding a pen. Whilst he was in hospital, I visited him at every given chance I could. He made me laugh with his stupid jokes and I loved seeing him smile and being able to ease his pain for a couple of seconds. Unfortunately his body was too weak to fight off the pneumonia he was admitted for and he sadly passed away. I remember this day like it was yesterday, it's an experience I never want to revisit.</p>
    <p>From the day he passed, he was on my mind constantly at school. It killed me everyday, knowing I was never going to be able to see him again. I would sit in lessons, feeling on edge and not being able to settle. I started struggling to sleep and would sit in bed for hours on end in floods of tears. Things were hard, and being a hormonal teenager didn't make it easier.</p>
